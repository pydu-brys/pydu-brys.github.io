      <p>
        I graduated from National Cheng Kung University
        with statistics as my major. In my senior year,
        I finished my first analytic project,

        I chose MIS as my graduate major to have more exposure of information technology training;
        at the same time, I constantly strengthened my analytical skills in the AI Lab.

      <p>
        Under Dr. Chen's guidance,
        I have been learning machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques,

      <p>
        I also like to travel, sing, and cook, cooking especially.
        I like to cook not only because I am a foodie, but because cooking, to me,
        is a stress-easing process (while not failing of course).
      </p>
      <p>
        Cooking is also a good realization of design of experiment,
        and a good course of courage (when failing).

            In this project, we aimed to explore the Pokémon spawning pattern with temporal and spatial

            We later utilized those features and metrics to develop a C5.0 Decision Tree prediction model for

            Abstract— Cyber-attacks cost the global economy over $450 billion annually. To combat this issue, researchers and practitioners put enormous efforts into developing Cyber Threat Intelligence, or the process of identifying emerging threats and key hackers. However, the reliance on internal network data to has resulted in inherently reactive intelligence. CTI experts have urged the importance of proactively studying the large, ever- evolving online hacker community. Despite their CTI value, collecting data from hacker community platforms is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we summarize our efforts in systematically identifying and automatically collecting a large-scale of hacker forums, carding shops, Internet-Relay-Chat, and DarkNet Marketplaces. We also present our efforts to provide this data to the larger CTI community via the<a href = "www.azsecure-hap.com"> AZSecure Hacker Assets Portal</a>. With our methodology, we collected 102 platforms for a total of 43,902,913 records.
